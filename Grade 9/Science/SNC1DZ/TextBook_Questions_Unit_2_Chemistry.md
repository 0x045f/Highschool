Solder Materials: Used to join together metal components, such as wires in electrical circuits and copper pipes in building, like glue.

2. **Use the particle theory to explain why water changes from a solid to a liquid when it is heated.**

    As water is heated, the particles or atoms gain energy, thus begin to spread apart and moving quicker, and when particles are spread     decently apart, that state is called a liquid state.
    
    
3. **Give 3 examples of a pure substance**
   1. Water
   2. Milk

5. **Describe a Mechincal Mixture**
  
   A mechinal mixture could be something like a cereal with milk, where you can see the cereal and milk easily.
   
6. **Describe a Solution**

  A solution could be something like apple juice, where there are different types of particles present, but are evenly mixed.
  
7. **Use a Venn diagram to compare mechanical mixtures and solutions**

9. **What kind of alloy makes an effective solder material?**
    Tin and lead make an effective solder material, as it is fluid at high temperatures but solidifies quickly.
    
10. **Lead is not often used in solder anymore. Explain why not.**    

    As lead is a heavy metal, it causes radioactive damage to humans, such as brain damage, which makes it harmful and unsafe.

1. **Dalton theorized that matter is made of tin, indivisible particles called atoms. In what way did the theories of each of theses scientist support or differ from Dalton's theory?**

- J.J Thomson
    - Also agreed in the existence of the atom, but also explainied that there are even smaller particles called the electron
- Ernest Rutherfort
    - Also agreed in the existence of the atom, but also explainied that there was an nucleus, that was the weight of the atom, which contained both protons and neutrons
- - James Chadwick also agreed in the existence of the atom, but also explained that were neutrons, which didn't have any charge at all

2. **In his experiments, J.J Thomson discovered a tiny stream of particles
    - Why did he conclude that these particles were negatively charged?
        - As opposites attract, and he found that the stream were attracted to the postive end of the circuit, he concluded that they were indeed negatively charged.

        - all of them to pass right through the foil
    - Why did the results surprise him?
        - As stated before his time, there were no existence of the proton, thus all the particles should pass right through the atom, yet some were deflected and hit unexpected parts of the screen
    - From his results, which articles were proposed as part of an atom?
        - the proton, or a postively charged particle
    - According to Rutherford, where in an atom are these particles located?

        - NH<sub>3</sub>
        
    - Carbon dioxide is formed when one carbon atom combines with two oxygen atoms
        - CO<sub>2</sub>
    - When there is insufficient oxygen, one carbon atom combines with only one oxgen atom, forming the deadly gas carbon monoxide
        - CO

5. **The formula for propane gas, often used as barbecue fuel, is C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>. The formula for butane, the liquid fuel in cigarette lighters is C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>. the was in a candle is a mixture of molecules, one of which is C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>62</sub>**
    - What is similar an what is different about the chemical compositions of these three substances?
        - They all contain a number of Hydrogen and Carbon elements, hydrogen being twice as much as carbon, except theres way more hydrogen and carbon in wax than propane
        
    - Consider the physical states of these three substances at room temperature and discuss any relationship you see between the formula and physical state
       - **ASK MS KERAS**
       
    - Are these three substances considered molecules? Give reasons for your answer
        - yes, as it fits the description of a molecule, being 2 or more of the different/same elements joined together

    - DONE, REMEBER TO ASK MS KERAS FOR CLARIFICATION    
7. **Explain the difference between a molecule and an ionic compound
     An ionic compound is a compound made up of 2 charged ions, while a molecule is made up of 2 or more atoms of the same or different      element(s)
