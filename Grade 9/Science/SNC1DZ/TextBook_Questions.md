## Questions to Ask Ms.Keras
1. How do you tell the difference between mechanical mixtures and a mixture/solutions?
2. Are qualitative properties and physical properties basically the same thing?
3. Are the families the akali, akaline, halogens and noble gases?
4. What was the zero sum rule?
5. Do all atoms want to get rid of only the outer shell electrons?
6. What are the elements I need to know?

## Page 178, Questions 3 - 10.

Alloys: When two or more types of metals are mixed together.

Solder Materials: Used to join together metal components, such as wires in electrical circuits and copper pipes in building, like glue.

2.  **Use the particle theory to explain why water changes from a solid to a liquid when it is heated.**

    As water is heated, the particles or atoms gain energy, thus begin to spread apart and moving quicker, and when particles are spread decently apart, that state is called a liquid state.
    
    
3. **Give 3 examples of a pure substance**
   1. Water
   2. Milk
   3. Apple juice

4. **Give three examples of a mixture**
  
   1. Soup
   2. Cereal with milk
   3. Granorla Bar

5. **Describe a Mechincal Mixture**
  
   A mechinal mixture could be something like a cereal with milk, where you can see the cereal and milk easily.
   
6. **Describe a Solution**

  A solution could be something like apple juice, where there are different types of particles present, but are evenly mixed.
  
7. **Use a Venn diagram to compare mechanical mixtures and solutions**  

   |Mechnical Mixtures|Both|Solutions|
   |:-----------------|:--:|--------:|
   |Apple Juice|
   
8. **Identify each of the following as a mechanical mixture or a solution**
  a. a pane of clear glass. **Solution**
  b. chocolate chip ice cream. **Mechanical Mixture**
  c. clear apple juice. **Solution**
  d. a pizza. **Mechanical Mixture**
  e. garbage in a garbage can. **Mechanical Mixture**
  
9. **What kind of alloy makes an effective solder material?**
    Tin and lead make an effective solder material, as it is fluid at high temperatures but solidifies quickly.
    
10. **Lead is not often used in solder anymore. Explain why not.**    

    As lead is a heavy metal, it causes radioactive damage to humans, such as brain damage, which makes it harmful and unsafe.

1. **Explain the difference between a qualitative property and a quantitative property**
  
    A qualitative property is a property that is of the **qualities** of an thing, for example, metal, which is very shiny and hard. A        qualitative property
     cannot be measured. 
  
    A quantitative property is something that can be measured, like the temperature of the metal, the mass or size of the metal.
  
2. **A student recoreded the following observations about a T-shirt. Classify each observation as a qualitative property or a quantitative property, and give reasons for your answers**  

    a. It is red and grey in colour. **Qualitative**, as it cannot be measured and is a quality of the object.
  
    b. It is 60 cm long. **Quantitative**, as it its measured in cm and is the length of the object.
  
    c. It is soft and strectchable. **Qualitative**, it is a property of the material.
  
    d. It will shrink in 70<sub>o</sub> water. **Qualitative**, it is a property of the material. **Ask MS KERAS**

3. **What physical properties are important for the materials used to make mountain bikes?**

5. **In each of the situations below, it seems that a new substance may have been produced. Explain why each situation represents a physical change.**

  * A tailor makes a new suit out of a piece of fabric
    - it is still a piece of the same fabric, thus no new substances have been produced, this is a physical change.
    
  * A chef makes a salad out of lettuce, tomatoes , and cucumbers
    - This is a mixture of different substances, but no new substances have been created, this is a physical change.
   
  * A mechanic builds a boat engine out of a lawnmower
    - The mechanic's lawnmower are still made of the same parts of the boat engine, thus no new substance was created.
    
  * A chemist boils slat water until only salt crystals are left.
    - The water evaporated but the salt was already present in the water, thus its a pyhsical change.
    
  * A child makes juice by adding water to juice concentrate
    - Juice already contains water, and adding more water just water downs the solution, but does not create a new substance.


## Pages 186 Questions 1 - 7

1. **Describe the diference between a physical change and a chemical change**
  In a physical change, no new substance is created, while a new substance is created in a chemical change.
  
2. **Explain why water freezing is not a chemical change.**
  As freezing water is just changing the state of water, water is still water, so there has been no new substance created.
  
3. **Classify each of the following as a physical or a chemical property**
  - metalic lustre **CHEMICAL**
  - boiling point **PHYSICAL**
  - explodes when ignited **CHEMICAL**
  - changes colour when mixed with water **CHEMICAL**
  
4. **Classify each of the following as a physical change or a chemical change. For each chemical change, explain how you can tell that a new substance has been formed**  

  - Water boils and turns into steam
    - Physical change, there is not new substance
  - Wood is sawed and made into a toy box
    - Pyhsical change, the toy box is still made up of the same wood

    - Chemical change, the ashes are the new substance
  - Orange drink crystals are stirred into a pitcher of water
    - Physical change, there is no new substance being created.
  - Sugar eggs, and flour are mixed and baked into cookies
    - Chemical change, the cake is the result of the ingredients reacting with bacterias and each other
    
5. **What evidence is there that a glowstick works as a result of a chemical change?**  
   The glowstick glows due to the two chemicals at both ends meeting each other, which a new lumious liquid is made.

6. **When a candle is lit and allowed to burn for 15 minutes, some wax drips and colelcts at the base of the candle, and the candle becomes shorter**
  - Did you observe any physical changes? Explain
    - yes, as the candle got shorter due to the flame buring it off.
  - Why did the candle become shorter? What happened to the missing section of the candle
    - the missing section of the candle turned into liquid due to the heat melting it.
  - Did you observe any evidence of chemical change?
    - **ASK MS KERAS**
7. **Think about each of the following situations and describe one chemical change that is occurring. provide evidence of the chemical change**
  - A driver starts the car in the drive way
    - The gasoline is being burned of to created electricity, and produces fumes that exit the car.
  - A bathroom cleaning product removes a stain in the sink
    - The chemicals in the product reacts with the stain, and the result is the removal of the stain.
  - Bubbles form when baking soda is mixed with lemon juice
    - The bubbles are the result of the chemical change
  - Cookies baking in the oven give off a delicious aroma
    - The ingredients are reacting with the heat to create the smell.
  - A match is struck and ignites
    - The friction of 2 substances sets off a chemical reaction that allows the match to light on fire
  - Bleach turns a red towel white
    - The bleach chemicals react with the pigments in the towel, resulting in the removal of the colour of the towel.
