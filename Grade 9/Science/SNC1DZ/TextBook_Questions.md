## Page 178, Questions 3 - 10.

Alloys: When two or more types of metals are mixed together.

Solder Materials: Used to join together metal components, such as wires in electrical circuits and copper pipes in building, like glue.

2. **Use the particle theory to explain why water changes from a solid to a liquid when it is heated.**

    As water is heated, the particles or atoms gain energy, thus begin to spread apart and moving quicker, and when particles are spread     decently apart, that state is called a liquid state.
    
    
3. **Give 3 examples of a pure substance**
   1. Water
   2. Milk
   3. Apple juice

4. **Give three examples of a mixture**
  
   1. Soup
   2. Cereal with milk
   3. Granorla Bar

5. **Describe a Mechincal Mixture**
  
   A mechinal mixture could be something like a cereal with milk, where you can see the cereal and milk easily.
   
6. **Describe a Solution**

  A solution could be something like apple juice, where there are different types of particles present, but are evenly mixed.
  
7. **Use a Venn diagram to compare mechanical mixtures and solutions**  

   |Mechnical Mixtures|Both|Solutions|
   |:-----------------|:--:|--------:|
   |Apple Juice|
   
8. **Identify each of the following as a mechanical mixture or a solution**
  a. a pane of clear glass. **Solution**
  b. chocolate chip ice cream. **Mechanical Mixture**
  c. clear apple juice. **Solution**
  d. a pizza. **Mechanical Mixture**
  e. garbage in a garbage can. **Mechanical Mixture**
  
9. **What kind of alloy makes an effective solder material?**
    Tin and lead make an effective solder material, as it is fluid at high temperatures but solidifies quickly.
    
10. **Lead is not often used in solder anymore. Explain why not.**    

    As lead is a heavy metal, it causes radioactive damage to humans, such as brain damage, which makes it harmful and unsafe.

1. **Explain the difference between a qualitative property and a quantitative property**
  
    A qualitative property is a property that is of the **qualities** of an thing, for example, metal, which is very shiny and hard. A        qualitative property
     cannot be measured. 
  
    A quantitative property is something that can be measured, like the temperature of the metal, the mass or size of the metal.
  
2. **A student recoreded the following observations about a T-shirt. Classify each observation as a qualitative property or a quantitative property, and give reasons for your answers**  

    a. It is red and grey in colour. **Qualitative**, as it cannot be measured and is a quality of the object.
  
    b. It is 60 cm long. **Quantitative**, as it its measured in cm and is the length of the object.
  
    c. It is soft and strectchable. **Qualitative**, it is a property of the material.
  
    d. It will shrink in 70<sub>o</sub> water. **Qualitative**, it is a property of the material. **Ask MS KERAS**
