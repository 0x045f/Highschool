# Physical Properties
- A characeristic of a substance that can be determined without changing the composition ("make-up") of that substance
- Characteristics can be determinded using your 5 senses and measuring instruments 
  - smell, taste, touch, hearing, sight
  - scales, tape, measuring meter
  
> # Qualitative and Quantitative Properties

> |Type|Definition|Example|
> |:---|:---------|:------|
> |Quantitative Property|A property that is |
> |Qualitative Property|A property that is NOT measured and has ```no numerical value```|

> ## Quantitative physical Properties
> - **```Density```**" amount of ```stuff``` (or mass) per unit volume (g/cm<sup>3</sup>)
> - **```Freezing Point```**

>> ## Common 

>> |Type|Definition|Example|
>> |:---|:---------|:------|
>> |Lustre: Shininess of dullness|Referred to as high or low lustre depending on the shininess|
>> |Clarity: The ability to allow light through||```Transparent``` (Glass) <br>```Translucent``` (Frosted Glass) <br>```Opaque``` (Brick)|
>> |Brittleness: Breakability or flexibility| Glass would be considered as brittle whereas slime/clay are flexible|
>> |Viscosity: The ability of a liquid or gas to resist flow or not pour readily through|Refer to as more or less viscous|Molasses is more viscous, water is less (gases tend to get"thicker as heated; liquids get runnier)|
>> |Hardness: The relative ability to scratch or be scratched by another substance|Referred to as high or low level of hardness. Can uses a scale (1 is wax; 10 is diamond)|
>> |Malleability: the ability of a substance ```to be hammered``` into a thinner sheet or molded||Silver is malleable<br> Play dough/pizza dough is less<br> glass is not malleable|
>> |Ductility: the ability of a substance to be pulled into a finer strand||Pieces of copper can be drawn into thin wires, ductile|
>> |Electrical Conductivity: The ability of a substance to allow electric current to pass through it|Refer to as high and low conductivity|Copper wires have high conductivity<br> Plastic has no conductivity|

> ## Crystalline vs. Amorphous Solids

# Chemical Property

> A characteristic (property) of a substance that describes its ability to undergo ```changes to its composition to produce one of more new substances. AKA BEHAVIOUR. Everything has one!```
> ```Cannot be determined by physical properties```

> E.g. ability of nails /cars to rust
> Firewors are explosive

> Denim is resistant to soap, but is combustible

> Baking soda reacts with vinegar and cake ingredients to rise

> Bacterial cultures convert milk to cheese, grapes to wine, cocoa to chocolate

> CLR used to clean kettles, showerheads because it breaks down minerals

> Silver cleaner for tarnished jewellery, dishes because silver reacts with air to turn black
