# Intervals

> ## How to determine an interval
> 1. Size matters
>    - Count the number of ```lines``` and ```spaces``` between and including the ones that the 2 pitches are on (+2)
>    - Do not count them as the enharmonic equivalent, a ```C flat``` is a ```C flat```, **```NOT```** a ```B```
> 2. Construct Table
>    - |Size|Number of Semitones|
>      |:---|:------------------|
>      |P 1|0|
>      |M 2|2|
>      |M 3|4|
>      |P 4|5|
>      |P 5|7|
>      |M 6|9|
>      |M 7|11|
>      |P 8|12|
>    - **Remember**: **```P, M, M, P, P, M, M, P```**
>    - **Remember**: **```0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12```**
> 3. Construct Keyboard
>    - Tone, Tone Semitone, Tone, Tone, Tone semitone
>    - Chop sticks
>    - Foot ball posts

> 4. Put 2 pitches on the correct notes on the key board
>    - put the pitches correct / corresponding to the key
> 5. Count the number of semitones
>    - Counting from one semitone to the other counts as **```ONE```** semitone
>    - Example: ```C``` to ```C#``` is **```ONE```** semitone
> 6. Find Quailty and Quantity of Interval
>    - Look to your table and see what is interval matching the correct number of semitones and size
>    - Example: An interval with the ```size of 5``` and ```7 semitones``` is a ```Perfect 5th```

> ## How to construct an interval
> 1. First count the size of the interval to find the note
> 2. Then count the correct number of semitones from the base note to find the pitch of the note
> - Example:
> - G is the base note, constuct a major 2 
>   - Count for 2 notes, you get A
>   - Count 2 semitones from G
>   - G -> G# (1 semitone), G# -> A (2 semitones)
>   - A is the correct answer

> Remember:
> The Grand Staff
> Lines are counter from the ```bottom``` to ```top```

> ## Treble Clef
> - F A C E 
> - <img src="https://cdn.instructables.com/F1F/8I2X/F3435SZ5/F1F8I2XF3435SZ5.LARGE.gif" width="300">
> - E G B D F
> - <img src="https://larawaymusic.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/egbdf.jpg" width="400">

> ## Bass Clef 
> - G B D F A
> - <img src="https://cdn.instructables.com/F3W/0LNL/F3435SZ2/F3W0LNLF3435SZ2.LARGE.gif" width="400">
> - A C E G
> - <img src="https://www.ultramusician.com/files/tutorials/notation/reading_bass_clef/ledger/aceg_mid.jpg" width="300">

> - The ```G Clef``` is The ```Treble Clef```
> - The ```F Clef``` is the ```Bass Clef```

> ## Ledger Lines
> - Only there to suppor the note
> - Do not write it above the note
> - Is to extend outside of the ```grand staff```

> ## Measure, Bar Line and Double Bar Line

> - Music is divided into equal parts by BAR LINES
> - The area between two barlines are called a MEASURE or a BAR
> - A DOUBLE BAR LINE is written at the end of a piece of music
>   - Its made up of one thin and one thick line
>   - The thick line is always on the outside
>   - On a grand Staff, the double bar line passes through the entire staff
> - When dividing barlines, be sure to divided evenly

# Unit 3
> ## Time Signature and Note Values
> - The UPPER number tells how many ```beats (or counts)``` are in each measure.
> - The LOWER number indicates what type of note receives 1 beat

> ## Whole Half and Quater Rests
> - **Remember**: ```B```at, ```H```at, ```S```quigly
> - **Remember**: If an entire bar/measure is rest, then mark it with a **```WHOLE```** rest, doesn't matter what time signature it is
> - <img src="http://i669.photobucket.com/albums/vv55/Neevitz/Theory%20-%20Rest%20Duration/Screenshot2011-02-23at22223PM.png" width="500">

> ## Ties and Slurs
> - Tie joins two notes of the ```same``` pitch
> - The tied note's value is added to the value of the first note
> - The tie should always be written on the opposite side from the note stems

# Unit 4
> ## Repeat Signs and Second Endings
> - Two dots placed before the double bar indicates a ```repeat sign```
>   it means to go back to the beginning
> ## First and Second endings
>  -It means after repeating from the end of the first ending, skip the first ending and go the second ending

> ## Eigth Notes
> - When you add a flag to the stem of a quarter note, it becomes EIGHTH NOTE
> - They are 1/2 of a quarter note
> - An even number of eight notes can be grouped together with something called a ```beam```

> ## Eigth Rest
> - Its equal to half the value of a quarter rest

> Dotted notes
> - a Dot represents a value of half of its original beat
> - Example: A dotted quarted note is 1.5 beats

> - Remember, E sharp is not the same thing as F

> ## Naturals
> - If the note was a sharp or a flat, cancel it out
