> ## Operations with Rationals
>> Q = { <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\inline&space;\dpi{100}&space;\fn_cm&space;\frac{a}{b}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;\dpi{100}&space;\fn_cm&space;\frac{a}{b}" title="\frac{a}{b}" /></a> | a, b &isin; Z, b &ne; 0 }     
>> 
>> Any operations with rationals, there are 2 sets of rules     
>>> 1. ```Rules for operations with integers```
>>> 2. ```Rules for operations with fractions```   

>> To Add / subtract rationals, find common denominator and then add / subtract numerator   
>> To Multiply rationals, first reduce the fraction to their lowest terms, then multiply numerators and denominators   
>> To Divide rationals, multiply them by the reciprocal   

>> ### Example Simplify Fully:

>> ## Scientific Notation
>>> They convey accuracy and precision. It can either be written as its original number or in scientific notation: 
>>> 555 (**Exact**) or 5.55 x 10<sup>2</sup> (**3 significant figures**).   
>>> In scientific notation, values are written in the form **a(10<sup>n</sup>)**, where ```a``` is a number within 1 and 10 and ```n``` is any integer. 
>>> Some examples include the following: 5.4 x 10<sup>3</sup>, 3.0 x 10<sup>2</sup>, and 4.56 x 10<sup>-4</sup>.    
>>> When the number is smaller than 1, a negative exponent is used, when the number is bigger than 10, a positve exponent is used

# Polyomials (2)
> ## Introduction to Polynomials
>> A ```variable``` is a letter that represents one or more numbers    
>> An ```algebraic expression``` is a combination of variables and constants ```(e.g. x+y+6.  y + 8)```     
>> When a specific value is assigned to a variable in a algebraic expression, this is known as substitution.    
> ## Methods to solve a polynomial
>> 1. ```Combine like terms```
>> 2. ```Dividing polynomials```
>> 3. ```Multiplying polynomials```

> ## Simplifying Alegebraic Expressions
>> An algebraic expression is an expression with numbers, variables, and operations. You may expand or simplify equations thereon.
     
> ## Factoring 
>>Two methods of solving; decomposition and criss-cross. First of all, the polynomial must be in the form of a quadratic 
>> equation (ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c). As well, simplify the polynomial, so that all common factors are outside      
>> (e.g 5x + 10 = 5(x + 2) ).     

>> |Type of Polynomial|Definition|
>> |:-----------------|:---------|
>> |Monomial|Polynomial that only has one term|
>> |Binomial|Polynomial that only has 2 terms|
>> |Trinomial|polynomial that only has 3 terms|

>> |Type|Example|
>> |:--:|:-----:|
>> |Perfect Square Trinomials| (a+b)<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup>+2ab+b<sup>2</sup> or (a-b)<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup>-2ab+b<sup></sup>|
>> |Difference with Squares|a<sup>2</sup>-b<sup>2</sup> = (a+b)(a-b)|
>> |Simple Trinomials|x<sup>2</sup>+6x-7 = (x+7)(x-1)|
>> |Complex Trinomials|2x<sup>2</sup>-21x-11 = (2x+1)(x-11)|
>> |Common Factor|2ab+6b+4 = 2(ab+3b+2)|
>> |Factor By Grouping|ax+ay+bx+by = (ax+ay)+(bx+by) = a(x+y)+b(x+y) = (a+b)(x+y)|

> ## Foil / Rainbow Method
>> <img src = "https://calcworkshop.com/wp-content/uploads/foil-method-formula.png" width ="500">

> ## Definitions
>> ```Term``` a variable that may have coefficient(s) or a constant     
>> ```Alebraic Expressions```: made up of one or more terms   
>> ```Like-terms```: same variables raised to the same exponent   

> ## Tips
>> Be sure to factor fully   
>> Learn the ```criss-cross``` (not mandatory but its a really good method to factor quadratics)   
>> Learn ```long division``` (not mandatory but its a really good method to find factors of an expression)    
>> Remember your formulas   
>> Simplify first, combine like terms        

# Solving Equations and Inequailties (3)
> ## Equations
>> a ```mathematical statement``` in which the value on the ```left side``` equals the value on the ```right side``` of the equal sign     
>> To ```solve``` and equation is to find the variable that makes the statement true
>> ### Methods to solve an equation
>>> 1. Expand and simplify both sides
>>> 2. Isolate using reverse order of operations
>>> 3. Check the solution by plugging the variable back into the equation and check if the ```left side``` equals the ```right side```
   
> 
> ## Absolute Values 
>> There are 2 cases. For this sort of equation, you must split the equation into 2 separate equations. One of the
>> equations will have the absolute bracket be positive while the other negative.   
>> Absolute values are written in the form ```| x |```
>> where    
>> if x > 0, | x | = x   
>> if x = 0, | x | = 0    
>> if x < 0, | x | = -x

> ## Quadractic Equations
>> ```Quadratic Function```: A parabolic graph where the axis of symmetry is parallel to the y-axis    
>> ```Quadratic Equation```: This function is set equal to ```0```. The solution to the equation are called ```roots```     
>> Solve quadratic equation by:    
>> 1. Isolation    
>> a(x+b)<sup>2</sup> + k = 0
>> 2. Factor using zero-product property    
>> ```The Zero Factor Property``` refers to when a&times;b=0, then either a=0 or b=0.     
>> (x-a)(x-b)=0    
>> x = a, b      

>> <img src="http://www.assignmentpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Quadratic-Expression-1.jpg" width="400">

>> Note:   
>> &radic;x<sup>2</sup> = &plusmn; x (There are 2 possible solutions)
>> ```Distrubutive Property``` - This is opening the bracket. a(x+y) = ax+ay    
    
> ## Tips
>> ```Absolute Values``` can have 2 solutions     
>> ```Quadratics``` can also have 2 solutions    
>> Make sure to do the reverse when moving things to the other side, meaning a positive on the ```left side``` becomes a negative on the ```right side```

> ## Labelling
>> Given any polygons, labelling the vertices must always:   
>> 1. use ```CAPITAL LETTERS```
>> 2. they have to be labeled in ```clockwise``` or ```counter-clockwise``` directions    
>> For a triangle, the side lengths are labeled in ```LOWERCASE LETTERS``` associated to the opposite side of the vertex   

>> <img src="http://www.technologyuk.net/mathematics/trigonometry/images/trigonometry_0073.gif" width="400">

> ## Median
>> Each median divides the triangle into 2 smaller triangles of equal area   
>> The centroid is exactly <img src="http://latex2png.com/output//latex_e25cac256b7164ee0e2f81c04f66d8ef.png" width="7"> the way of each median from the vertex, or <img src="http://latex2png.com/output//latex_e49d25791981be91167b2d965ce50d51.png" width="7"> the way from the midpoint of the opposite side, or ```2:1``` ratio   
>> The three medians divide the triangle into ```6``` smaller triangles of equal area and ```3 pairs``` of congruent triangles   

>> <img src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/d-median.png" width="500">

> ## Terms:
>> ```Altitude``` The height of a triangle, a line segment through a vertex and perpendicular to the opposite side    
>> ```Orthocenter```: where all 3 altitudes of the triangle intersect      
>>> <img src="https://mathbitsnotebook.com/Geometry/Constructions/orthocenter1a.jpg" width="300">
>> ```Midpoint```: A point on a line where the length of either side of the point are equal   
>> ```Median```: A line segment joining the vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side     
>> ```Midsegment```: A line joining 2 midpoints of the 2 sides of a triangle   
>> ```Centroid```: The intersection of the 3 medians of a triangle   
>>> <img src="http://www.mathwords.com/c/c_assets/centroid.jpg" width="300">

> ## Proportionality theorem:
>> The midsegment of a triangle is ```half``` the length of the opposite side and ```parallel``` to the opposite side   
>> Three midsegment of a triangle divide ```4 congruent``` triangles with the same area   
>> The Ratio of the outer triangle to the triangle created by the 3 midsegments is ```4 to 1```

> ## Tips
>> Make sure to know your optimization formualas   
>> Read the word problems carefully, determine which formual to use   
>> Never **ASSUME**, be sure to **CALCULATE** as most of the time the drawings are **NOT ACCURATE**   
>> To find ```missing area```, take what you have, subtract what you don't want      
>> Don't be afraid to draw lines to help you solve the problem   


# Analytical Geometry and Linear Relations (5)
> ```Linear Relation```: A relation which a single straight line can be drawn through every data point and the first differences are constant   
> ```Non - Linear Relation```: A single smooth curve can be drawn through every data point and the first differences are not constant   
> ## Slope and Equation of Line   
>> ```Slope```: The measure of the steepness of a line - ```rise / run``` or ```the rate of change```       
>> ```Slope Formula```: **m = (y<sub>2</sub>-y<sub>1</sub>)/(x<sub>2</sub>-x<sub>1</sub>)**    
>> ```Standard Form```: **ax + by + c = 0**, a&isin;Z, b&isin;Z, c&isin;Z (must be integers and ```a``` must be positive)   
>> ```Y-intercept Form```: **y = mx + b**    
>> ```Point-slope Form```: **y<sub>2</sub>-y<sub>1</sub> = m(x<sub>2</sub>-x<sub>1</sub>)**   
>> The slope of a vertical lines is undefined    
>> The slope of a horizontal line is 0
>> Parallel lines have the ```same slope```   
>> Perpendicular slopes are negative reciprocals    

> ## Relations
>> A relation can be described using   
>> 1. Table of Values (see below)   
>> 2. Equations (y = 3x + 5)   
>> 3. Graphs (Graphing the equation)    
>> 4. Words 
>> When digging into the earth, the temperature rises according to the
>> following linear equation: t = 15 + 0.01 h. **t** is the increase in temperature in
>> degrees and **h** is the depth in meters.

> ## Perpendicular Lines
>> To find the perpendicular slope, you will need to find the slope point   
>> Formula: slope1 &times; slope2 = -1   
>> Notation: m<sub>&perp;</sub>   
>> <img src="https://www.varsitytutors.com/assets/vt-hotmath-legacy/hotmath_help/topics/parallel-perpendicular-lines/parallel_perpendicular_lines_1.gif" width="300">   


> ## Definitions
>> ```Parallel```: 2 lines with the same slope   
>> ```Perpendicular```: 2 lines with slopes that are the negative reciprocal to the other. They form a 90 degree angle where they meet.      
>> ```Domain```: The **ordered** set of all possible values of the independent variable (x).   
>> ```Range```: The **ordered** set of all possible values of the dependent variable (y).   
>> ```Continous Data```: A data set that can be broken into smaller parts. This is represented by a ```Solid line```.   
>> ```Discrete Data```: A data set that **cannot** be broken into smaller parts. This is represented by a ```Dashed line```.   
>> ```First Difference```: the difference between 2 consecutive y values in a table of values which the difference between the x-values are constant.   
>> ```Collinear Points```: points that line on the same straight line

> ## Variables
>> ```Independent Variable```: A Variable in a relation which the values can be chosen or isn't affected by anything.   
>> ```Dependent Varaible```: A Variable in a relation which is **dependent** on the independent variable.   

> ## Statistics
>> ```Interpolation```: Data **inside** the given data set range.   
>> ```Extrapolation```: Data **outside** the data set range.   
>> ```Line of Best Fit```: A line that goes through as many points as possible, and the points are the closest on either side of the line,
>> and it represents the trend of a graph.   
>> ```Coefficient of Correlation```: The value that indicates the strength of two variables in a relation. 1 is the strongest and 0 is the weakest.   
>> ```Partial Variation```: A Variation that represents a relation in which one variable is a multiple of the other plus a costant term.   

> ## Time - Distance Graph
>> Time is the independent variable and distance is the dependent variable   
>> You can't go backwards on the x-axis, as you can't go back in time   
>> Plot the points accordingly   
>> Draw the lines accordingly   
>> <img src="https://dryuc24b85zbr.cloudfront.net/tes/resources/6061038/image?width=500&height=500&version=1519313844425" width="400">   

>> **Direction is always referring to:**

>> 1. ```go towards home```    
>> 2. ```going away from home```   
>> 3. ```stop```    

> ## Scatterplot and Line of Best Fit
>> A scatterplot graph is there to show the relation between two variables in a table of values.    
>> A line of best fit is a straight line that describes the relation between two variables.    
>> If you are drawing a line of best fit, try to use as many data points, have an equal amount of points onto and under the line of best fit, and keep it as a straight line.   
>> <img src="https://www.varsitytutors.com/assets/vt-hotmath-legacy/hotmath_help/topics/line%20of%20best%20fit-eyeball/lineofbestfit-e-1.gif" width="300">    

>> ### How To Determine the Equation Of a Line of Best Fit
>> 1. Find two points **```ON```** the ```line of best fit```
>> 2. Determine the ```slope``` using the two points
>> 3. Use ```point-slope form``` to find the equation of the ```line of best fit```

> ## Table of values
>> To find first differences or any points on the line, you can use a ```table of values```

>>| y | x |First Difference|
>>|:--|:--|:---------------|
>>|-1|-2|.....|
>>|0|-1|(-1)-(-2) = 1|
>>|1|0|0 - (-1) = 1|
>>|2|1|1 - 0 = 1|
>>|3|2|2 - 1 = 1|
>>|4|3|3 - 2 = 1|

> ## Tips
>> Label your graph correctly, the scales/scaling and always the ```independent variable``` on the ```x-axis``` and the ```dependent variable``` on ```y-axis```   
>> Draw your ```Line of Best Fit``` correctly   
>> Read the word problems carefully, and make sure you understand it when graphing things     
>> Sometimes its better not to draw the shape, as it might cloud your judgement (personal exprience)   
>> Label your lines

# System of Equations (6)

> ## Linear System
>> Two or more equation that you are working on all together at once on the same set of axes.    
>> The lines may ```cross``` or ```intersect``` at a point called the ```Point of Intersection (POI)```.    
>> The coordinated of the ```POI``` must satisfy the equation of all the lines in a linear equation.    

>> In business, the ```Point of Intersection``` is known as the **Break Even Point** where ```Revenue - Cost = Profit```    
>> when **Profit = 0**. There is no gain or loss.

>> ### Number of Solutions

> ## Discriminant
>> The discriminant determines the number of solutions (roots) there are in a quadratic equation. ```a```, ```b```, ```c``` are the 
>> coefficients and constant of a quadratic equation: ```y = ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c```    
>> D = b<sup>2</sup> - 4ac    
>> D > 0 ```(2 distinct real solutions)```     
>> D = 0 ```(1 real solution)```    
>> D < 0 ```(no real solutions)```

> ## Solving Linear-Quadratic Systems
>> To find the point of intersection, do the following:     
>> 1. Isolate both equations for ```y```
>> 2. Set the equations equal to each other by ```subsitution``` Equation 1 = Equation 2
>> 3. Simplify and put everything on one side and equal to zero on the other side
>> 4. Factor
>> 5. Use zero-product property to solve for all possible x-values
>> 6. Subsitute the x-values to one of the original equations to solve for all y-values
>> 7. State a conclusion / the solution

> # Ways to solve Systems of Equations
> 1. Subsitution   
> Here we eliminate a variable by subbing in another variable from another equation   
> We usually do this method if a variable is easily isolated   
> Example:
>   - ```
>     y = x + 10  (1)
>     x + y + 34 = 40 (2)
>     ```
>     We can sub (1) into (2) to find ```x```, then you the value of ```x``` we found to solve for ```y```
>     ```x + (x + 10) + 34 = 40```   
>     ```2x + 44 = 40```    
>     ```2x = -4```   
>     ```x = -2```   
>     Then solve for ```y```   
>     ```y = -2 + 10```   
>     ```y = -8```

> 2. Elimination
> Here we eliminate a variable by basically eliminate a variable from an equation   
> We usually use this method first when the variables are not easily isolated, then use subsitution to solve   
> Example:
>   - ```
>     2x + 3y = 10 (1)
>     4x + 3y = 14 (2)
>     ```
>     We can then use elimination
>     ```
>     4x + 3y = 14
>     2x + 3y = 10
>     ------------
>     2x + 0 = 4
>     x = 2
>     ```
>     Then sub the value of ```x``` into an original equation and solve for ```y```   
>     ```2(2) + 3y = 10```   
>     ```3y = 6```   
>     ```y = 2```   

> 3. Graphing
> we can rewrite the equations into ```y-intercept form``` and then graph the lines, and see where the lines intersect (P.O.I), and the P.O.I is the solution

> ## Solving Systems of Linear Inequalities
>> Find the intersection region as the ```solution```.   
>> ## If:

>> |  |Use ```Dash``` line|Use ```Solid line```|   
>> |:-|:------------------|:-------------------|   
>> |Shade the region ```above``` the line|y > mx + b|y &ge; mx + b|   
>> |Shade the region ```below``` the line|y < mx + b| y &le; mx + b|    

>> ## If   

>> |x > a <br> x &ge; a|
>> |:------------------| 
>> shade the region on the **right**   

>> ## If   

>> |x < a <br> x &le; a|   
>> |:------------------|   
>> shade the region on the **left**   

>> Step 1. change all inequalities to ```y-intercept form```   
>> Step 2. graph the line   
>> Step 3. shade the region where all the regions overlap
