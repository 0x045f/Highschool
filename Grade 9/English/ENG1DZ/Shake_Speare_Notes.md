- Padua(the town) is kind, Hortensio says he wish its true
- The widow now decides to mock Katherina, makes very little since
    - This shows that katherina has changed greatly

    - She talks about the things that Petrhucio has done to her, to mock Lucentio and Hortensio
    - She also uses this oppurtunity to riducule Bianca, as before, she would've gotten in trouble, but now since she is following orders, its a different situation
    - Might be meant to be hyperbolic, as its very long
    - The fact it is sounding akward, as she is not suppose to believe it
    - Shakespeare made it sound weird, so we don't agree with it
    - L.174 Our strengths weak
    - We see that they kiss without sexual harrasment, show that they are in a working relationship
    - You won, you hit the `white`, which is also implying Bianca.
